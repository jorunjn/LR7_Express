# LR7_Express
# Routing 

The application provides a simple RESTful API for managing researchers and experiments in a laboratory.

**Routing structure:**
- `GET /researchers` – returns a list of all researchers  
- `GET /researchers/:id` – returns a researcher by ID  
- `POST /researchers` – creates a new researcher  
- `PUT /researchers/:id` – updates a researcher by ID  
- `DELETE /researchers/:id` – deletes a researcher by ID  

- `GET /experiments` – returns a list of all experiments  
- `GET /experiments/:id` – returns an experiment by ID  
- `POST /experiments` – creates a new experiment  
- `PUT /experiments/:id` – updates an experiment by ID  
- `DELETE /experiments/:id` – deletes an experiment by ID  

The server runs locally at `http://localhost:3000` by default.
